# Two Sum

## Problem Summary

You're given an array of integers and a target value. Return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

## My Approach

- Use nested loops.
- Compare all possible pairs.
- Track indices when sum matches target.

## What I Learned

- Watch out for duplicate indices.
- O(n^2) is fine for small input, but not scalable.

## Time Complexity

- Time: O(n²)
- Space: O(1)

## Revisit?

Yes – hash map approach
